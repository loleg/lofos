# Lófos

Electric mobility makes it easier to get from point A to point B, but our range is limited by battery capacities. Personal mobility devices especially have to use lightweight batteries and usually do not go more than 10-20 km before they need a charge. Until a revolutionary engineering breakthrough is made, users of such devices have to rely on the availability of power outlets along the way to their further destinations.

At the Energy Hackdays 2016 we have sketched and made a basic app prototype to show some of the functionality we are thinking of. We are also proposing a set of open/crowdsourced datasets that together with a mobile/augmented app would allow users of personal mobility new levels of freedom of movement. We will continue further developing this project after additional research into the latest data sources for enhancing urban mobility.

## Next data sources

Our next steps are to start collecting open data sources or create a crowdsourced database for some of the following:

- eVehicle battery data
- Public electric sockets (e.g. PlugShare)
- Elevation data (currently we use Google Maps API)
- Traffic (obstacles, lights, ..)

## Next interfaces

We are fascinated by data visualisation in Virtual/Augmented/3D/Printed/QR/NFC and other "tangible" contexts. Here are some commercial and research projects which make this connection of new data sources and new data interfaces:

Sidenote: the name of the project comes from the Greek λόφος, meaning hills. We are inspired by [Odysseus](http://polasekj.sweb.cz/photo.htm) and his hilly birthplace [Ithaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithaca).
